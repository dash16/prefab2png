This Python script renders layered map images from game files used by the game **7 Days to Die**. It creates layers of labeled points of interest (POIs) using in-game data, suitable for editing or display.

## Overview

This script converts the `prefabs.xml` file from a 7 Days to Die world into layered `.png` maps. Each layer shows a category of prefabs—organized by biome, street, or player start location.  This script focuses on Navezgane, but could be easily adapted for any world map.

Prefab POIs with in-game names are included. Decorations, filler assets, and unnamed POIs are excluded. `player_start` and named street sign locations are also included.

Prefab difficulty tiers (0–5) are color-coded based on an optional `diff.csv` file.

- `Localization.txt` – From game data path
- `biomes.png` – Used to identify biome per prefab

## 📦 Output

Default output directory: `output/`

Contents:
- `biome_forest_points.png`, etc. – Prefab dots per biome
- `..._labels.png` – Label overlays
- `combined/` – Optional combined PNG per category and all layers
